<p>I’d like to live with You...</p>
<p>Marina Tsvetaeva</p>
<p>I’d like to live with You
<br>In a small town,
<br>Where there are eternal twilights
<br>And eternal bells.
<br>And in a small village inn —
<br>The faint chime
<br>Of ancient clocks — like droplets of time.
<br>And sometimes, in the evenings, from some garret —
<br>A flute,
<br>And the flautist himself in the window.
<br>And big tulips in the window-sills.
<br>And maybe, You would not even love me…</p>

<p>In the middle of the room — a huge tiled oven,
<br>On each tile — a small picture:
<br>A rose — a heart — a ship. —
<br>And in the one window —
<br>Snow, snow, snow.</p>

<p>You would lie — thus I love You: idle,
<br>Indifferent, carefree.
<br>Now and then the sharp strike
<br>Of a match.</p>

<p>The cigarette glows and burns down,
<br>And trembles for a long, long time on its edge
<br>In a gray brief pillar — of ash.
<br>You’re too lazy even to flick it —
<br>And the whole cigarette flies into the fire.</p>
